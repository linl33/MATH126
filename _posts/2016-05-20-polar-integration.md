Some difficult double integration problems turn into simple double integrations when the coordinate system is transformed
to the polar coordinate system. This notion of making a problem solvable through simple transformations fascinates me.
This makes problem solving seems like it's all about your point of reference. The transformation from the Cartesian
coordinate system to the Polar coordinate system is like shifting our point of reference from that of a square to a circle.

Before seeing polar integration I never realized that this kind of shift of perspective happens everywhere in Math.
The various substitution techniques for simple integrations use the same idea of shifting perspectives, by transforming
functions to a certain form. Another example is the similarity between imaginary numbers and 2-d vectors.

I thought the notion of "perspective" only exists in social sciences, because answer to problem in hard sciences and
Math is definitive. Today I realized that a definitive answer does not mean the process of obtaining the answer is
definitive, and that I should always be open minded to see the different perspectives.
